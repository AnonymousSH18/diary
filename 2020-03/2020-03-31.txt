## life
I had an interview with programing school. He suggested for me to class. But, tuition fee is so expensive. I've already suffered from univ tuition feeI can't get more munny. The other cumpony said "our class is flee". So, I wanna try it.
After interview, I went to school and prepared for research. I could install Macpork and but, I didn't understand how to operate. 
I googled how to open file in command line.Then, open command is useful in macos. I tried to open .png file. It coule be work!!
After school , I went to shopping and got soil and pot.These are not expensive however, It's so tough to bring back to my house.
## good thing
I may get another monitor for my desktop near future. 
I could cook dinner.
I knew how to display sub script on youtube.
